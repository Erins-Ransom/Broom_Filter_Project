\begin{abstract}
	Bloom filters and other approximate membership query data structures, or AMQs, are often used to help avoid costly lookups to large dictionaries.  They achieve this by keeping a small, probabilistic representation of a set {\bf S} of keys from a universe {\bf U}.  All AMQs support inserts and lookups while some also support deletes.  When performing a lookup for an item $x$ that has been inserted, i.e. $x\in {\bf S}$, the AMQ will always return {\it true}.  The downside of their compact representation of {\bf S} is that, when a lookup is performed for an item $x \notin {\bf S}$, {\it true} may be returned with probability $\epsilon$.  This {\bf false-positive probability} is a usually a tunable parameter with a lower $\epsilon$ typically requiring more space to be used by the AMQ.  That said, their compact representation is also what makes them helpful since they can be kept in memory or on a local machine and queried locally to avoid having to access disk or another machine over a network.  This being the case, two of the primary concerns when analyzing an AMQ are then, how often does it return false-positives and how much space does it require to do so?

	The majority of current AMQs offer strong guarantees for individual queries; however, the false-positive probability rates for most can be pushed toward 1 given the right sequence of queries.  There are some recent AMQs that have been designed to account for this shortcoming, we call these {\bf adaptive} AMQs in that they maintain a false-positive probability of $\epsilon$ for every lookup regardless of the answers to previous lookups.

	The goal of this project is to implement a proveably adaptive AMQ.  We need to add more here about what we are trying to accomplish...
